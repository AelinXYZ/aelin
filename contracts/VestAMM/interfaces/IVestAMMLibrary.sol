// Integration notes
// we will deposit capital into AMMs all at once using deployPool
// or just addLiquidity if a pool already exists. Inside of these methods
// we will get back a specific amount of LP tokens. This will be the case
// even for Uniswap v3 since we will work with projects that wrap the NFT and return ERC20
// we will need to take the wrapped tokens and send them to a contract where they will be
// owned by NFTs held by each of the participants in the pool and maybe the protocol if
// they are keeping LP units. then we will need to call remove liquidity one user at a time
// when people call claim to vest their tokens. Each integration will need to have its own
// set of arguments passed depending on the AMM and how it works. For AMMs that automatically
// reinvest trading fees we will need to figure out a way to determine how much has been
// earned in fees and capture 10% of this amount as protocol fees. For AMMs that do not
// automatically reinvest trading fees we will need to collect the fees, distribute 10%
// to the AELIN protocol as fees and 90% back to the user
// this is all we need from an integration side with any AMM
